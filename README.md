# No Logging

This plugin disables logging to improve performance. It does not disable logging entirely like errors/exeptions and certain urgent warnings.

## Plugin Installation
To use the plugin, please install PluginLoader (https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginLoader). After you install PluginLoader successfully, go to the plugins menu from the main menu and select No Logging. Click Apply and you will be asked to restart the game. Click Yes to restart the game and you done! Manual Plugin Installation without PluginLoader is not supported!
